<h2>What is the warzone?</h2>
<p>The warzone is an isolated network simulating the entire IPv4 internet, on which all connected devices are targets to be hacked. Unlike wargames, the warzone allows players to connect their own hackable servers or devices with any software they like, as long as it speaks IP.</p>

<h2>1. Create an account</h2>
<p>To exist on the warzone, you need an account. Setting up an account is easy and painless. Click on the <em>Register</em> button, select a username and register. Once your account has been activated, you will be able to use the warzone and its applications.</p>
<p><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#step1">Read more/less</a></p>
<div id="step1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<p>All authentication in the warzone is based on public-key cryptography, to avoid having to store password hashes that may be leaked through a compromise later.</p>
<p>Upon registration, your browser creates a keypair and transmits the public key to the registration service in SPKAC format. Once the account is activated, the registration service presents a signed certificate (signed by the warzone CA) to your browser. This certificate is automatically detected as belonging to the keypair that was generated earlier and registered in your computer's secure key vault.</p>
<p>None of these steps require your interaction and at no point is the private key sent anywhere.</p>
When your browser visits the warzone, it can be informed that the remote party accepts certificates signed by the warzone CA. You will then be prompted if you wish to authenticate against that website with your warzone credentials. The authentication process is again painless and requires little interaction.

<h2>2. Activate applications</h2>
<p>With an account, you can get access to applications in the warzone (e.g. the VPN). To get access, you must activate the application so that it is aware of your account. You will find a list of available applications on the Overview page.</p>

<div id="step2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<p>Because authentication in the warzone is based on public-key cryptography, we basically get single-signon functionality for free. Any website accepting warzone credentials can easily verify whether a visitor has valid credentials by comparing the presented certificate against the warzone CA, both public information.</p>
These websites or applications, can offer services available to visitors with accounts in the warzone. An application may need to keep track of application-specific information about you, such as a list of IP addresses which you &quot;own&quot; on the warzone VPN network. This is why an application needs to be &quot;activated&quot; for first use.

<h2>3. Create keys and roles</h2>
<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#step3">Read more/less</a>
<div id="step3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<p>In the unlikely event that the private key locked inside your browser is exposed and stolen, your warzone account is compromised. Someone with access to your private key would be able to impersonate you on the warzone and get full access to all the warzone applications for which you signed up.</p>
<p>If you plan to connect your own game to the warzone, you will have to copy credentials onto that game in order for it to connect to the warzone VPN. If that game gets breached (which is a real possibility, since that is the purpose of the warzone), those credentials will be compromised. In that case, it would be favorable that you had not used the credentials of your warzone account.</p>
<p>This is why the warzone registration service allows you to register throw-away credentials called &quot;subkeys&quot;. A subkey is basically a keypair that you generate offline and then attach to your warzone account. Once activated, this keypair can then be used for any purpose. If the key is compromised, you can revoke it, making it useless to whoever stole it.</p>
<p>In addition to being revocable, subkeys have an RBAC role attached to them which allows you to limit what they can be used for.</p>
<p>Each application you sign up for, will give you a set of permissions and with the RBAC system, you can select which of those permissions are accessible for a certain subkey.</p>
<p>As a practical example, assume you sign up for the VPN app and get access to three fixed IP addresses A, B and C. If you set up a game which only needs access to IP address A, you can create a role that only has this permission and attach it to the subkey you use for this game. When the game is compromised, you can drop the subkey and attach that same role to a new subkey.</p>
