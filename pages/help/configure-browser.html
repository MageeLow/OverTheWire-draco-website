<p>Following <a href="/#/help/register">account registration</a>, you can now download the configuration tarball from your profile page. This configuration tarball contains a signed certificate which, together with your private key, can be used to authenticate yourself to the Warzone registry.</p>
<h2 id="generating-the-pkcs12-file">Generating the PKCS#12 file</h2>
<p>To configure the browser, the private key and signed certificate have to be combined into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12">PKCS#12</a> file. This can easily be accomplished through the <code>consume-client-credentials.sh</code> (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenVanAcker/OverTheWire-draco-tools/master/consume-client-credentials.sh">download</a>) script in the <a href="https://github.com/StevenVanAcker/OverTheWire-draco-tools">Draco tools</a> repository. This script is executed with the shown arguments: <code>./consume-client-credentials.sh &lt;tarball&gt; &lt;private key&gt;</code></p>
<p>For an example user <code>johndoe</code>, with tarball <code>johndoe.tar.gz</code> and private key <code>user.key</code> the output would be:</p>
<pre><code>johndoe@home:~$ ./consume-client-credentials.sh johndoe.tar.gz user.key
    [DEBUG] Your username: johndoe
    [DEBUG] You will be prompted for a password to protect the PKCS12 file.
    Enter Export Password:
    Verifying - Enter Export Password:

    Your OpenVPN credentials are in johndoe-openvpn.tar.gz
    Your registry credentials are in johndoe-registry.p12</code></pre>
<p>The file <code>johndoe-registry.p12</code> is the PKCS#12 file that can be loaded into your browser to authenticate yourself to the Warzone.</p>
<h2 id="loading-the-pkcs12-file-into-your-browser">Loading the PKCS#12 file into your browser</h2>
<p>The process of actually loading the PKCS#12 file into your browser, is browser specific. Here are some links to help you find documentation on how to do this for some popular browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://google.com/?q=install+client+certificate+google+chrome">Google Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://google.com/?q=install+client+certificate+mozilla+firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://google.com/?q=install+client+certificate+microsoft+internet+explorer">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://google.com/?q=install+client+certificate+opera">Opera</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ensuring-that-it-works">Ensuring that it works</h2>
<p>To make sure the certificate was loaded correctly, go to <a href="https://draco.overthewire.org"></a>. Your browser should prompt you to select the identity with which you want to authenticate to this website. If successfully authenticated, your username will be shown in the top-left corner. Going to your profile will also indicate that you are viewing your own profile.</p>
