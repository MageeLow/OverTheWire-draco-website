Draco warzone
=============

*This is a work in progress, that's why this documentation sucks*

* [Warzone overview](/#/help/overview)
* [Account types](/#/help/account)
* [Registering an account](/#/help/register)
* Connecting to the warzone
* [Connecting vulnerable hosts](/#/help/connecting-vulnhosts)

To do list
----------

In no specific order:

- fixing documentation
- adding a scoreboard
- vulnhost dependencies
- linking up multiple warzones
- an ircbot that indicates hosts connecting/disconnecting
